This project implements a Privacy-Preserving Federated Intrusion Detection System (FedIDS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV).
It combines Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) to enable collaborative training across distributed clients without exposing raw data.

The system includes:
- Clientâ€“Server FL setup using Flower and PyTorch.
- Differential Privacy integration for secure model updates.
- Model training & testing utilities for IDS datasets.
- Interactive dashboard (Streamlit) for real-time monitoring and results visualization.
